This is a fork of Roblox's "Endorsed Weapons Kit".
It includes some bug/error fixes from original kit, as well as a camera release script located in StarterClientScripts.

## Installations
To get the forked model, you can follow these instructions:

# Instructions for Roblox Studio
Get the model here: TBD
Go to Roblox Studio, open a place and open your toolbox. Then go to the second tab and select "My Models". Drag the model you've taken from Roblox website to viewport or explorer. Place the folders to their respective places. For example, if a folder is under a model named "ReplicatedStorage", put it to ReplicatedStorage **without** including the model instance. If you are still unsure about the process, check out my video about it (TBD) or inspect the place located in source code's StudioPlace folder. Download and open it for an example.

# Instructions for Rojo Sync
Clone the repository, you will have all models as rbxmx. I don't have scripts separately yet, I'm open for PR's about this.
ServerStorage has TagList tags for weapons.

## Usage
Once you install it, it's done! Use the guns from Roblox's kit for other guns. Delete WeaponsSystem folder inside of them after you insert these guns. Alternatively, you can use your own guns, however do not forget to set them up like how Roblox has theirs set up. You should consider having Tag Editor (https://www.roblox.com/library/948084095/Tag-Editor) for custom guns so you can tag them as "WeaponsSystemWeapon".

If you have more questions, you can open an issue.
